## 🎯 Objective

**Build an usable and pleasant web page that interacts with arrays, objects, functions etc... with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.**

## 🏗 Prerequisites

1. Be sure **to have a clean working copy**.

This means that you should not have any uncommitted local changes.

```sh
❯ cd /path/to/workspace/lego
❯ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

2. **Pull** the `master` branch to update your local with the new remote changes

```sh
❯ git remote add upstream git@github.com:92bondstreet/lego.git
## or ❯ git remote add upstream https://github.com/92bondstreet/lego
❯ git fetch upstream
❯ git pull --rebase upstream master
```

4. **Open the entry point [../client/v2/index.html](../client/v2/index.html)** in your browser (that loads - among others - the [../client/v2/portfolio.js](../client/v2/portfolio.js) file)

```sh
# macos cli
❯ open client/v2/index.html
# linux cli
❯ xdg-open client/v2/index.html

# or by double-clicking in your browser files
```

5. **Check the rendering of your browser webpage**

## 📱 Features

I will describe each feature with the [Agile User Story template](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/user-story-template/).

A [User Story](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories) is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user or customer.

A user story should typically have a summary structured this way:

1. **As a** [user concerned by the story]
1. **I want** [goal of the story]
1. **so that** [reason for the story]

### Feature 0 - Show more

So that I can load more deals

### Feature 2 - Filter by best discount

### Feature 7 - Display Vinted sales

As a user for a given set id<br>
I want to display vinted sales<br>
So that I can easily identify current sales for a given set id

### Feature 8 - Specific indicators

As a user for a given set id<br>
I want to indicate the total number of sales<br>
So that I can understand the sales market

### Feature 9 - average, p5, p25 and p50 price value indicators

As a user for a given set id<br>
I want to indicate the average, p5, p25 and p50 price value<br>
So that I can understand the sales prices for a given set 

### Feature 10 - Lifetime value

As a user for a given set id<br>
I want to indicate the Lifetime value<br>
So that I can understand how long a set exists on Vinted

### Feature 11 - Open product link

I want to open deal link in a new page<br>
So that I can buy the product easily

### Feature 12 - Open sold item link

## 👩‍💻 Just tell me what to do

1. **Solve each `User Stories`** inside [../client/v2/portfolio.js](../client/v2/portfolio.js) file with JavaScript

    <img src="./img/2-portfolio.png" width="75%"/>


2. Once an User Story is solved, **commit your modification**:

    ```sh
    ❯ cd /path/to/workspace/lego
    ❯ git add -A && git commit -m "feat(display): show 6, 12 or 24 deals"
    ```

    ([why following a commit message convention?](https://dev.to/chrissiemhrk/git-commit-message-5e21))

3. **Commit early, commit often**
4. Don't forget **to push before the end of the workshop**

    ```sh
    ❯ git push origin master
    ```

    **Note**: if you catch an error about authentication, [add your ssh to your github profile](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/).

10. Check that your codebase works by checking the console output
11. If you need some helps on git commands, read [git - the simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

### Don't forget. 4 Focus.

* DOT - Do One Thing
* LIM - Less Is More
* If you change the [../client/v2/index.html](../client/v2/index.html) selectors, you should probably update [../client/v2/portfolio.js](../client/v2/portfolio.js) file
* English only: codebase, variables, comments...

**Focus on coding and web design**
